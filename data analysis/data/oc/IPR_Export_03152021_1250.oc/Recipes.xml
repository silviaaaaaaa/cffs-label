        2. Fill the tilt skillet with water, add baking soda and bring to a boil.

        3. Place all your eggs into the large fryer baskets so that there is still room for them to mingle and cook
        evenly!!! You can use 3 of them so 40 in each! Simmer all of them for 6.5 MINUTES ONLY!!!

        4. While the eggs are cooking get your ICE BATH ready - big bins so that you can sock the eggs right away after
        the timer goes off!

        5. After they cool for a few minutes, peel all the eggs and place them into the mixture mentioned before and let
        them marinate for 3-4 days till they are served with Ramen.
