        1. PRE-SOAK Beans overnight!
        - 2 X 20L CAMBRO Containers
        - HALF of the Beans in Each
        - Filled with 12L of Water Each

        2. Drain beans from their hydration liquid. Your cooking water should be different from your soaking water.

        3. Using the small steam kettle, cook beans slowly in 20 extra liters of water. They should be good to start at
        250F.

        4. Cook the beans until they are soft, but not decomposing. During the cooking process it is important to skim
        off the foamy protein that will accumulate at the surface of the cooking beans&apos; water - this, if unchecked,
        will lead to a poor bitter taste and a lesser shelf life for the beans themselves.

        5. While the beans are cooking, saute your onions in oil, until dark brown. Caramelize them as far as they will
        go, and then add cumin and garlic. Saute cumin and garlic for 5 minutes, and then take off heat.

        6. Turn off steam kettle when the beans are cooked, and let beans sit. Take 4L of the cooking water, and set
        aside.

        7. Drain beans, and then transfer them into a neutral container greater than 40L in volume. Get the large
        Immersion Blender.

        8. Add the onion mixture with the garlic and cumin, as well as half of the salt, and half of the brown sugar.
        The remaining halves - set aside, and use to SEASON TO TASTE.

        9. With the Immersion Blender, blend about 4L of the bean mixture into a puree - and then add back into the rest
        of the beans, and mix. Add reserve liquid from the cooking, until you get - not a soup - beans with a puree of
        more beans.

        - Drain Cannelini Beans. The Yield on these beans has been calculated in this recipe - roughly the loss of over
        a Kilogram in &quot;Aqua Fava&quot;. A quick rinse is valued, but not entirely necessary.

        - Half all Grape Tomatoes. You will notice in this recipe that 5 LBS is the measured amount require. This is
        because each box of Grape Tomatoes that comes in from Freshpoint is 10 LBS - meaning: use half of a box for this
        recipe. Easy enough?

        - Small Dice Red Onions. Saute with Cumin and Cayenne, adding 1 Bag of Frozen Corn and Red Pepper to the mix
        along the way. Do not roast this Corn in the oven for any reason - its starches develop and it becomes tough
        texturally. Deglaze this mixture with Apple Cider Vinegar, and season.

        - Pick Oregano. Don&apos;t bother picking the Cilantro, as some stem is fine in this recipe. Rough Chop both of
        these, and reserve to add into the rest of this recipe.
