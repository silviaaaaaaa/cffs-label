        1. -THIS RECIPE IS A TOUGHT ONE; CRISPY SHALLOTS ARE AN ART FORM. PLEASE FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY, AND GET
        CHEF TO DO THIS WITH YOU ONCE BEFORE TRYING IT ON YOUR OWN.

        2. Mandoline Shallots into thin rings - Approx. 2mm.

        3. Created a Salt/Water Brine at 10% salt (100g Salt: 1000ml Water). Soak mandolined Shallots in Brine for 10
        minutes. Rinse once with clean water, and let rest for 20 minutes.

        4. At 325-350F, fry Shallots until golden. Shallots will continue cooking once you take them out - and set them
        on a tray lined with paper towel. IMPORTANT: as soon as you take the Shallots out of the fryer, and onto their
        blotting surface of paper towel, you will need to move them around so that they don&apos;t clump up and form
        balls or nests (which, once dried, will not come apart easy). THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GETTING A GOOD PRODUCT.
