        Prep:

        - Quarter Corn Tortillas. 2.5 Packages of Corn Tortillas will yield 2 Deep Hotel pans full of Corn Chips.

        - Using Paper Towel, create a large pan or bowl for draining the excess oil off of the Tortilla Chips, after
        they&apos;ve come out of the Deep Fryer.

        - At 350 Degrees (F) in the Deep Fryer, fry NO MORE THAN HALF OF A STACK OF CORN TORTILLAS (QUARTERED) at a
        time.

        - Using a Spider, or Long Tongs - KEEP TORTILLAS MOVING AT ALL TIMES.

        - Depending on how dark the Deep Fryer oil is, fry the Tortilla Chips until they are brown (keeping in mind that
        they will cook for a little while longer once they&apos;ve been taken out of the fryer.

        - As soon as the chips are out drying, salt lightly using the Windsor coarse grain salt. The salt will only
        stick during this stage of production - be sure to catch it!

        Method:

        1) Set milk out to warm up while doing other steps.

        2) In pot melt the butter over medium heat

        3) Add the flour through fine mesh chinois while whisking melted butter to insure that no lumps are formed.

        4) Stir until the mixture is smooth and with out lumps, this is the time to be more careful. Cook for 1 minute
        so the flour becomes tastier and absorbs the fats. The roux should be a nice golden colour.

        5) Add warm milk to roux in a steady stream, whisking continuously. Simmer on low heat until it starts to
        thicken, but insure it does not come to a boil. Whisk in the salt and pepper mix, and nutmeg, taste for
        seasoning and adjust if needed. Set aside for recipe.
