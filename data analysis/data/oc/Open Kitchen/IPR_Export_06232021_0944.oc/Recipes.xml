        - At 350 Degrees (F) in the Deep Fryer, fry NO MORE THAN HALF OF A STACK OF CORN TORTILLAS (QUARTERED) at a
        time.

        - Using a Spider, or Long Tongs - KEEP TORTILLAS MOVING AT ALL TIMES.

        - Depending on how dark the Deep Fryer oil is, fry the Tortilla Chips until they are brown (keeping in mind that
        they will cook for a little while longer once they&apos;ve been taken out of the fryer.

        - As soon as the chips are out drying, salt lightly using the Windsor coarse grain salt. The salt will only
