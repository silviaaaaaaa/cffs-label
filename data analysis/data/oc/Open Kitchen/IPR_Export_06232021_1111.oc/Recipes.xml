        the milk, salt and pepper.

        5. Blend with a hand mixer to ensure the egg and cream mixture is completely homogenous (mixed thouroughly)

        6. Spread the desired fillings on the bottom of the pie crust. Pour the egg mixture on top (leave a 1/2 cm of
        head space at the top of the quiche as the eggs will souffle and expand) Bake at 350 degrees for about 20-25
        minutes (check after 15 mins) The quiche will be slightly wobbly in just the center.(this allows for carry over
