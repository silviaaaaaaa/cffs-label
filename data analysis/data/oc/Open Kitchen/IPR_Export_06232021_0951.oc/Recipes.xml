        Method:

        1. Prepare all Mise En Place items that are dry, and combine. Sift together if you have time.

        2. Add Egg, and 50% of the water, and mix with a whisk.

        3. Then, add the vinegar, and continue mixing. A chemical reaction will occur at this point between the vinegar
        and baking soda.

        4.If necessary, add the remaining water. Otherwise, do not, and let the mixture be by itself. It should be
        roughly the consistency of soft serve ice cream.

        NOTE: This batter should be stored in the freezable containers in the Vegetable Containers, meant for squeeze
        bottles and other things that stand at room temperature.

        [This is where I would normally write &quot;Label/Date/Store!&quot;, but since this is made several times per
        day, and never stored overnight - the container NOTE was written instead.]

        2. Mandoline Shallots into thin rings - Approx. 2mm.

        3. Created a Salt/Water Brine at 10% salt (100g Salt: 1000ml Water). Soak mandolined Shallots in Brine for 10
        minutes. Rinse once with clean water, and let rest for 20 minutes.

        4. At 325-350F, fry Shallots until golden. Shallots will continue cooking once you take them out - and set them
        on a tray lined with paper towel. IMPORTANT: as soon as you take the Shallots out of the fryer, and onto their
        blotting surface of paper towel, you will need to move them around so that they don&apos;t clump up and form
        balls or nests (which, once dried, will not come apart easy). THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GETTING A GOOD PRODUCT.

        Method:

        1. In a large pot bring the water to a boil. Add the rice, lentils, bayleaf and 1/2 the salt. Bring back to a
        boil, turn heat down to medium and lid, leaving lid slightly ajar.
        Simmer for 30-35 minutes or until the rice and lentils are tender. Drain, reserving at least 1 1/4 C (281g) of
        cooking liquid (it will be used later to make the sauce). Place the rice and lentils back in their cooking pot,
        lid and set aside off heat.

        2. *A note about the veggies. Be sure they&apos;re diced small, otherwise they&apos;ll be crunchy-ish at the end
        of cooking. We&apos;re looking for them to be soft.

        3. In a large Rondeau add the oil and heat until shimmering. Add the bell pepper, onion and celery. Turn the
        heat to low. Stir. Cook, stirring occassionally for about 12-15 minutes. The veggies are done when the they&apos;re
        tender/soft and brown bits (fond – the brown bits that stick to the bottom of the pan) are just starting to
        appear in the pan.

        4. To the pan of veggies, add the tomato paste, garlic, Cajun or Creole seasoning and remaining 1/2 salt. Stir
        to coa the veggies. Pour in 3/4 C (180g) of the reserved cooking liquid from the lentils and rice. Stir.

        5. To the pan, add the drained kidney beans. Stir. Heat should be on medium-low to low. Lid the pan and gently
        cook the beans through for about 8-10 minutes. Check on the beans a few times while cooking and If needed, add
        just a bit more cooking liquid from the reserved liquid. Your beans should be saucy, and moist, not dry.

        6. Turn the heat to low and transfer the drained rice and lentils to the bean mixture. Add Worcestershire sauce.
        Add the lemon juice and to taste for seasoning, adjust if necassary; then gently fold all the ingredients
        together.
        If needed, to loosen the mixture or if it starts to get too dry, add a splash of cooking liquid - you&apos;ll
        probably not use it all - thats okay. Taste for salt. Lid. Leave on low heat for 3-5 minutes just to warm
        though, checking to make sure it isn&apos;t sticking - the pan should be almost dry, with a moist (but not
        sticky) rice mixture.
