        Method:

        1. PRE-SOAK Beans overnight!
        - 2 X 20L CAMBRO Containers
        - HALF of the Beans in Each
        - Filled with 12L of Water Each

        2. Drain beans from their hydration liquid. Your cooking water should be different from your soaking water.

        3. Using the small steam kettle, cook beans slowly in 20 extra liters of water. They should be good to start at
        250F.

        4. Cook the beans until they are soft, but not decomposing. During the cooking process it is important to skim
        off the foamy protein that will accumulate at the surface of the cooking beans&apos; water - this, if unchecked,
        will lead to a poor bitter taste and a lesser shelf life for the beans themselves.

        5. While the beans are cooking, saute your onions in oil, until dark brown. Caramelize them as far as they will
        go, and then add cumin and garlic. Saute cumin and garlic for 5 minutes, and then take off heat.

        6. Turn off steam kettle when the beans are cooked, and let beans sit. Take 4L of the cooking water, and set
        aside.

        7. Drain beans, and then transfer them into a neutral container greater than 40L in volume. Get the large
        Immersion Blender.

        8. Add the onion mixture with the garlic and cumin, as well as half of the salt, and half of the brown sugar.
        The remaining halves - set aside, and use to SEASON TO TASTE.

        9. With the Immersion Blender, blend about 4L of the bean mixture into a puree - and then add back into the rest
        of the beans, and mix. Add reserve liquid from the cooking, until you get - not a soup - beans with a puree of
        more beans.

        -cool, store, label and rotate this item with older product correctly and diligently.

    <Recipe id="P-41913" image="">1. Measure all and get your ingredients together.

        2. Place everything into a medium pot and turn your burner on to medium low.

        3. Bring to a low simmer and turn down a tad so it barely bubbles. Simmer for about 40 minutes.

        4. After 40 minutes, turn off and let the oil sit and cool down.

        5. Grab a cointainer, chinoise(china cap) and grease filter and filter the oil from the other ingredients. The
        oil should be a nice flourescent red color.
