        Prep:

        - Quarter Corn Tortillas. 2.5 Packages of Corn Tortillas will yield 2 Deep Hotel pans full of Corn Chips.

        - Using Paper Towel, create a large pan or bowl for draining the excess oil off of the Tortilla Chips, after
        they&apos;ve come out of the Deep Fryer.

        - At 350 Degrees (F) in the Deep Fryer, fry NO MORE THAN HALF OF A STACK OF CORN TORTILLAS (QUARTERED) at a
        time.

        - Using a Spider, or Long Tongs - KEEP TORTILLAS MOVING AT ALL TIMES.

        - Depending on how dark the Deep Fryer oil is, fry the Tortilla Chips until they are brown (keeping in mind that
        they will cook for a little while longer once they&apos;ve been taken out of the fryer.

        - As soon as the chips are out drying, salt lightly using the Windsor coarse grain salt. The salt will only
        stick during this stage of production - be sure to catch it!
